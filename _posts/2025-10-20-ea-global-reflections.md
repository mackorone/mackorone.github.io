title: "EA Global Reflections"
---

Last week, I attended the 2025 EA Global conference in NYC. Given that I've had
limited involvement with Effective Altruism thus far, I wasn't exactly the
target audience, but I'm happy I decided to go. (Thanks to the folks at
[80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) for encouraging me to apply.)

The event mostly centered around networking. About a week before the event, I
used Google Gemini to analyze the attendee spreadsheet and recommend who I
should connect with, and this mostly worked.

I spoke with a few folks with similar backgrounds and goals to mine---career
technologists looking to increase their impact---along with some folks
with drastically different interests and cause areas: the environment, animal
welfare, global health, etc. The conversations were engaging but it's unclear
whether they actually benefitted either party. (There were exceptions of
course, such as a chat with an ex-teacher who shared good insights and advice,
and with whom I hope to maintain a connection.)

The talks I attended were quite good---highlights include a keynote by Sjir
Hoeijmakers, the CEO of [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/),
and an overview of the current state of AI policy by New York Assemblymember
Alex Bores---but there weren't enough of them to keep me busy, so it was back to
networking.

By the end of the first day, I was completely burned out and had to take a nap
in the designated nap room, which was actually quite nice. (Air mattresses
organized neatly into rows, gentle lighting, etc.) I decided to opt out of the
second day of the conference in favor of some other tasks that needed doing.

Immediately following the conference, I wasn't quite sure I got my money's worth
($500 is the regular price of attendance) but upon further reflection I think
I gained some valuable perspective that made the whole thing worth it:

- Most people at EA Global didn't fully subscribe to the "maximum impact at any
cost" philosophy that I previously assumed was pervasive. The fact that other
people didn't neglect their own needs and desires---as irrational as they might
be---makes me feel better about attending to my own, too. Teaching might be
low-leverage to some, but if it makes me happy, who's to say I shouldn't do it?

- Along those same lines, I think I've finally realized that I don't need---or
want---to change the whole world. As a human being with finite energy, it's
exhausing and depressing to think about things at that scale. Instead, I think I
much prefer being a big fish in a small pond, making a big difference for the
people closest to me.

- Almost everyone I spoke with wanted to know how *they* could get a job like
*mine*, something adjacent to AI safety at a top research lab. It made me
realize that, despite the suboptimal parts of the job, I'm incredibly lucky to
be where I am. It reinvigorated my desire to do good work and hopefully steer
us---ever so slightly---towards a better future.

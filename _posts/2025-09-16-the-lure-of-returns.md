title: "The Lure of Returns"

My YouTube feed is filled with videos about how to beat the market. Lots of
people trying lots of things to make a bit more money than the next guy.

It reminds of the search for a perpetual motion machine. Lots of interesting
ideas, none of them actually work, and somehow no one realizes that they're
attempting to violate the laws of physics. The lure of returns is simply too
tempting to think clearly.

Yes, there are inefficiencies. Yes, people get rewarded for finding them. But
those people aren't you and me. They're big companies that spend ungodly amounts
of money to be the best at what they do. They employ brilliant people to build
incredibly complicated systems to compete with other big companies. There is no
value left over for you or I to extract.

For the average person, winning in the market is no different than winning at
the casino; you had a good day, but it wasn't because you studied long enough
and hard enough to beat the house. There is no edge to be had; it's all luck.
The only way to win is to refuse to play---to stop trying to beat the market.

I don't fault people for playing. The whole thing is counterintuitive and
confirmation bias is one hell of a drug. But I'm growing weary with the total
imbalance of "timing the market" versus "time in the market" content. We need
more channels like [Ben Felix](https://www.youtube.com/@BenFelixCSI),
[The Plain Bagel](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePlainBagel), and [Personal Finance
Club](https://www.youtube.com/@personalfinanceclub)---or perhaps they exist and
I just need to find them.

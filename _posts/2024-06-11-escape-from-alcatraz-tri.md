title: "The Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon: Overpriced"
tags: [fitness, money]

In 2023, I participated in the
[Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon](https://www.escapealcatraztri.com/). I meant to
write a race report back then, but I never got around to it. This past weekend
was the 2024 edition of the race, so I figured now is as good a time as any to
share one thing I've wanted to say since last year's race: it's not worth
the price.

For $837---yes, almost $1000---I got:
- A ferry ride to the swim start
- A "bucket list" swim experience
- A forgettable ~20 mile bike ride
- A forgettable ~8 mile run (sand ladder notwithstanding)
- A heavy-duty grocery bag
- A hooded towel

Personally, I'd recommend folks just do the
[Alcatraz Swim](https://www.odysseyopenwater.com/alcatraz) with Odyssey
Open Water Swimming instead, which "only" costs ~~$245~~ $295. In case it's
helpful, here's [my review]({% post_url 2023-05-15-alcatraz-swim %}) of that
event.

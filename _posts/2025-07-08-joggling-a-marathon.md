#### Discussion

Sometime within the last year or so, I discovered joggling and it struck me as
something particularly quirky and challengingâ€”right up my alley. I added
"joggle a race" to my bucket list and got back to whatever I was doing, most
likely a YouTube rabbit hole.

Months later, I attempted joggling for the first time during the [Lockport
10 race](https://www.strava.com/activities/13578389540). Surprisingly, it
was easier than I thought. (The running candence and the juggling cadence
actually line up quite nicely.) Then and there, I decided that I wanted to
joggle a full race, start to finish, by the end of the year.

With not much else on the calendar, the Buffalo Marathon struck me as a
good opportunity to try long-distance joggling. So, I decided to give it a shot.
I wasn't originally planning on joggling the whole thing, but the first half
marathon went better than expected so I decided to keep going. Plus, I had
promised a bunch of spectators that I'd joggle the whole way and I'm not one to
disappoint.

It took me over five hours, but I actually joggled the 2025 Buffalo
Marathon. To be clear, I had a bunch of drops and I stopped at the aid stations,
but otherwise I juggled the entire time.

A few random notes:

- Spectators *loved* it. Almost everyone I passed cheered me on, expressed
disbelief, and/or shouted jokes. (My favorite was, "Nice set of balls!"). Some kid
told his friend, "He's him." Other participants were less enthusiastic,
especially the ones I passed towards the end: "Oh, come on!"
- The trickiest part about joggling is not actually juggling, it's seeing where
you're going. I relied on Zach's guidance during the first half marathon and made
a few wrong turns during the second half.
- Sunglasses are an absolute must. They prevent dry eyes (sometimes you
forget to blink) and save you when the sun just-so-happens to be exactly where
your looking while juggling.
- The farthest I had joggled up until that point was three miles. I should've
trained better, because by the end of the race my forearms were killing me and I
ended up with a minor case of tendonitis.
- All in all, it was a 10/10 fun experience that I never want to do again.

Life lessons:

1. **Embrace challenge**: meaningful experiences happen outside of your comfort zone
1. **Drops happen**: nobody is perfect, mistakes happen, pick yourself up and keep going
1. **Pace yourself**: life is a marathon, not a sprint, slow and steady wins the race
1. **Appreciate the journey**: don't just rush to the finish line, smell the roses
1. **No one does it alone**: behind every successful person is a society

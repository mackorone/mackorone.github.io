title: Why I Like pip-tools

A few years ago, I was
[introduced](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive/pull/39) to a
piece of software called [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/).
Since then, I've been using it religiously in all of my Python projects. This
post is a quick overview of why I think it's great.

At a high level, pip-tools solves the dependency management problem.
Here's how the problem usually presents itself:
1. Start writing something in Python
1. Download a package into the current virtual environment
1. `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to keep track of the dependency
1. Over time, remove all usages of the package but forget to update
`requirements.txt`
1. Several months later, find yourself with a behemoth of a `requirements.txt`
file, not quite sure which are dependencies (or versions) are necessary to
actually run your program. Spend hours running `pip remove`, `pip install
--upgrade`, and `pip freeze` in a futile attempt to clean up your environment
and `requirements.txt`. Give up and resign to just installing everything
everywhere.

Pip-tools solves this problem by separating direct dependencies from transitive
dependencies, automatically managing the latter, and providing commands for
easily upgrading package versions and syncing the specified versions into your
environment.

That was a lot of words. I think a quick demo will help to illustrate.

First, create a virtual environment if necessary and activate it:
```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install pip-tools:
```bash
pip install pip-tools
```

Then create a pip-tools package configuration file, conventionally called
`requirements.in`. Here's what it might look like for a project that uses
`aiohttp`, an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework:
```bash
aiohttp
```
Then, to turn configuration file into a universally recognized
`requirements.txt` file, simply run:
```
pip-compile requirements.in
```

Here's what the generated `requirements.txt` might contain:
```
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with Python 3.10
# by the following command:
#
#    pip-compile requirements.in
#
aiohttp==3.9.1
    # via -r requirements.in
aiosignal==1.3.1
    # via aiohttp
async-timeout==4.0.3
    # via aiohttp
attrs==23.1.0
    # via aiohttp
frozenlist==1.4.0
    # via
    #   aiohttp
    #   aiosignal
idna==3.6
    # via yarl
multidict==6.0.4
    # via
    #   aiohttp
    #   yarl
yarl==1.9.3
    # via aiohttp
```

A few things to note:
1. **All packages are version-pinned**; this is both a good security practice (your
software won't automatically pick up newly published, potentially malicious
versions) and ensures production deployments match the development environment.
1. **The dependency graph is captured and annotated**; it's easy to
tell, at a glance, which packages were installed and, more importantly, *why*
they were installed. Pip-tools is even smart enough to remove packages when
they're no longer necessary.
1. **`pip-compile` is reproducible**; it will continue to generate the same
`requirements.txt` file, even if new versions of your direct dependencies are
available. Adding new dependencies never affects existing dependencies. And you
can always explicitly ask pip-tools to upgrade the pinned versions via
`pip-compile --upgrade`. In short, you're always in control of your package
versions.

The coolest part, in my opinion, comes after the `requirements.txt` is
generated. You can easily install all necessary dependencies, and *uninstall*
unnecessary ones, by running the following:
```bash
pip-sync requirements.txt
```

The "uninstall unnecessary ones" is crucial to ensuring that you're not
unknowingly depending on some package that just-so-happens to be installed on
your machine, but not in production. With pip-tools, you can be confident that
if your dependencies are happy on your machine, they'll be happy in other
environments, too.

Oh, and one more thing: you can have multiple "requirements" files, one for each
environment. So if you wanted [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), a Python
linter, to also be available at development time, you could create a
`requirements-dev.in` file containing the following lines:
```bash
-r requirements.in
ruff
```

Running `pip-compile` on it would produce a `requirements-dev.txt`
file that contains both your production dependencies--in this case, just
`aiohttp`--*and* your development dependencies, ready for `pip-sync`-ing.

I'll be the first to admit that pip-tools has a non-zero learning curve, but
`pip-compile` and `pip-sync` quickly become second nature, and the time saved
from not having to worry about dependency management adds up quickly. If you
haven't done so already, do yourself a favor and check it out.

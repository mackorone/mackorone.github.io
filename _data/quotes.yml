- quote: The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company...a church....a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of our attitudes.

If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies; Succeed anyway. If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you; Be honest and frank anyway. What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight; Build anyway. If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous; Be happy anyway. The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow; Do good anyway. Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough; Give the world the best you've got anyway. You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and your God; It was never between you and them anyway.

Wonder. Laughter. Hope. The world can be better because of what you built in the past... try and make sure that the things you're working on pushes in the right direction. They don't have to be big projects. They might just have an audience of one. And even if they don't last, try to make sure that they leave something positive behind.

- quote: The most carefree time of your life is over. That's a fact. You're an adult now, and unless your parents are filthy rich, you can never go back to thinking about the world the way a child does, where all of your needs are someone else's responsibility and you simply focus on what you want. But that was always going to end. And what's more, the older you get, the more you'll find that it wouldn't even make you happy to have it back. Because pleasure is not happiness, except when you're a child. Where you once sought pleasure, now you are old enough and smart enough to seek fulfillment. This is the time of your life when you get to really know yourself, find out what's meaningful to you, what you care about enough to go after it with all of your ability. And then you have the rest of your life to do those things! That's where your happiness will be found. There and nowhere else.
